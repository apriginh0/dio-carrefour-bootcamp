MELHORES PR√ÅTICAS

Redux Style Guide:
priority A - Essential, priority B - Strongly Recommended, priority C - Recommended
Essential: Do not mutate State, Reducer must not have side effects, Do not put non-serializable
values in State or Actions, Only one Redux Store Per App

DESIGN PATTERNS

Ducks Pattern: To me, it makes more sense for these pieces to be bundled together in an isolated
module that self contained, and can even be packaged easily into a library
1 MUST export default a function called reducer()
2 MUST export its action creators as functions
3 MUST have action types in the form 'npm-module-or-app/reducer/ACTION_TYPE'
4 MAY export its action types as UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, if an external reducer needs to listen
for them, or if it is a published reusable library
